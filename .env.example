# Tina CMS Configuration
# These environment variables are needed for production builds on Netlify

# Tina Cloud GraphQL endpoint (production)
# Get this from your Tina Cloud dashboard at https://app.tina.io
# Example: https://content.tinajs.io/content/<your-client-id>/github/<branch>
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_URL=

# Alternative Tina API URL (fallback)
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_API_URL=
TINA_API_URL=

# Tina Cloud read-only token (optional, for private repos)
# Get this from your Tina Cloud dashboard
TINA_TOKEN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_TOKEN=

# Instructions for Netlify:
# 1. Go to Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment
# 2. Add the NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_URL with your Tina Cloud GraphQL endpoint
# 3. If needed, add TINA_TOKEN for authentication
# 
# Without these, the build will use filesystem fallback (reads from content/ folder)
# which is slower but still works for static generation.
