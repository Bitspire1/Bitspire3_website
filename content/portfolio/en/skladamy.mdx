## About the Project

SkładaMy is a modern e-commerce platform specializing in modular furniture sales. The key element of the project was an advanced product configurator that allows users to personalize furniture in real-time.

## Challenges

- Creating an intuitive configurator interface with real-time preview
- Performance optimization for complex user interactions
- Integration with warehouse management system (API)
- Achieving high Core Web Vitals scores
- Responsiveness across all devices

## Solution

### Technical Architecture

We chose **Next.js 14** with App Router, which allowed us to:
- Server-side rendering for better SEO
- Optimal resource loading
- Utilization of React Server Components for better performance

### Product Configurator

The interactive configurator was built using:
- **React State Management** – efficient configuration state handling
- **Canvas API** – real-time product preview rendering
- **Debouncing** – API call optimization during configuration changes

### Performance Optimization

- **Image Optimization** – automatic image optimization through Next.js
- **Code Splitting** – code division into smaller chunks
- **Lazy Loading** – delayed component loading
- **Edge Caching** – CDN utilization for static resources

## Results

- ✅ **Core Web Vitals**: all metrics in green range
- ✅ **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
- ✅ **FID** (First Input Delay): < 100ms
- ✅ **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1
- ✅ **Conversion increase**: +35% compared to previous version
- ✅ **Session time increase**: +45%

## Technologies

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React Hook Form
- Zustand (state management)
- REST API integration
- Vercel (hosting)
