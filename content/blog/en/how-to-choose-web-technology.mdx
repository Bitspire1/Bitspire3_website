## Introduction

Choosing the right tech stack is one of the most important decisions you'll make at the start of a project. In 2025, we have more options than ever before, which can be both a blessing and a curse.

## Key Selection Factors

### 1. Project Requirements

Before choosing technology, you need to thoroughly understand:

- **Project goal** - is it a corporate website, e-commerce app, or SaaS?
- **Scalability** - how many users do you expect to serve?
- **Functionality** - what features are crucial for your business?
- **Budget** - how much can you allocate to development and maintenance?

### 2. Performance and SEO

In 2025, speed and SEO optimization are critical:

**Next.js 15** offers:
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) out of the box
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Automatic image optimization
- Built-in routing

**Gatsby** works great for:
- Static sites with lots of content
- Blogs and corporate websites
- Projects requiring ultra-fast loading

### 3. Developer Experience

Choose technologies that:

- Have an active community
- Have good documentation
- Are supported by large companies or foundations
- Have a rich ecosystem of tools

## Popular Tech Stacks in 2025

### Stack #1: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

**Best for:** Most web projects, business applications, e-commerce

**Advantages:**
- Great performance thanks to SSR/SSG
- Excellent SEO
- TypeScript provides type safety
- Tailwind speeds up development

**Example usage:**
```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen bg-slate-900">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white">
        Welcome to Next.js 15!
      </h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Stack #2: React + Vite + shadcn/ui

**Best for:** Single Page Applications, dashboards, internal apps

**Advantages:**
- Lightning-fast development thanks to Vite
- Full control over routing
- shadcn/ui provides ready-made components
- Great DX

### Stack #3: Astro + MDX

**Best for:** Content-heavy websites, blogs, documentation

**Advantages:**
- Ultra-fast loading (zero JS by default)
- Partial hydration
- Supports components from different frameworks
- Perfect for static content

## Red Flags - What to Avoid

❌ **Don't choose technology just because it's "hot"**
- Trendy doesn't always mean suitable for your case

❌ **Don't overestimate your capabilities**
- A stack you don't know means longer development time

❌ **Don't ignore maintainability**
- In a year, you'll have to maintain it all

❌ **Don't forget about the team**
- The best technology is the one your team knows

## Questions You Must Ask Yourself

1. **Do I need SSR?**
   - If SEO is critical → Next.js, Nuxt
   - If not → React/Vue SPA

2. **How large will the application be?**
   - Small/medium → Next.js, Astro
   - Large enterprise → Next.js with monorepo

3. **Will content change frequently?**
   - Yes → CMS (Tina, Sanity) + Next.js
   - No → Static site (Astro, Gatsby)

4. **What team do I have?**
   - JavaScript developers → React ecosystem
   - Mixed → Framework with good documentation

## Summary

Technology choice is a balance between:
- **Project requirements** vs **team capabilities**
- **Performance** vs **development speed**
- **Modernity** vs **stability**

There's no one universal solution. The key is understanding your project's specifics and making an informed decision based on facts, not trends.
