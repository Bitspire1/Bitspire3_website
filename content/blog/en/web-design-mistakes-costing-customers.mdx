## Introduction

A well-designed website isn't just about aesthetics - it's a tool that converts visitors into customers. Unfortunately, many companies lose potential profits through design mistakes that are easily avoidable.

## 1. Slow Loading Speed

**Problem:** Page loads longer than 3 seconds.

**Consequences:**
- 53% of mobile users abandon the site
- Google lowers search ranking
- Up to 80% conversion loss

**Solution:**
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
- Use CDN
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript
- Implement caching

```javascript
// Image lazy loading example
<Image
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Hero"
  loading="lazy"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
/>
```

## 2. No Mobile-First Design

**Problem:** Site looks bad on mobile devices.

**2025 Statistics:**
- 68% of internet traffic is mobile
- 88% of users don't return to poorly functioning mobile sites

**Solution:**
- Design for mobile first
- Test on various devices
- Use responsive design
- Buttons min. 44x44px

## 3. Chaotic Navigation

**Problem:** Users can't find what they're looking for.

**Bad Practices:**
- More than 7 menu items
- Hidden or unusual menus
- No breadcrumbs
- Nested submenus (more than 2 levels)

**Solution:**
```
✅ Simple structure
✅ Logical grouping
✅ Search bar
✅ Sticky navigation
```

## 4. Poor Contrast and Readability

**Problem:** Text is hard to read.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Gray text on white background (#999 on #FFF)
- Too small fonts (below 16px)
- No typographic hierarchy
- Text on busy backgrounds

**WCAG Guidelines:**
- Minimum: 4.5:1 for normal text
- Minimum: 3:1 for large text
- Font size: min. 16px for body

## 5. Overwhelming Content

**Problem:** Too much information at once.

**F-Pattern Rule:**
Users scan pages in an F shape:
1. Horizontally at top
2. Horizontally in middle (shorter)
3. Vertically on left side

**White Space is King:**
- 50-60 characters per line
- Spacing between sections
- Empty areas around CTAs

## 6. Unreadable Forms

**Problem:** Complicated forms drive users away.

**Bad Examples:**
❌ 15 fields to fill
❌ No real-time validation
❌ Unclear error messages
❌ Forcing account for purchase

**Best Practices:**
```html
<!-- Good form example -->
<form>
  <label for="email">Email *</label>
  <input 
    type="email" 
    id="email" 
    required
    aria-describedby="email-error"
    placeholder="john@example.com"
  />
  <span id="email-error" class="error"></span>
</form>
```

✅ Only necessary fields
✅ Autofill enabled
✅ Progress bar for long forms
✅ Guest checkout option

## 7. Unclear CTAs (Call to Action)

**Problem:** Users don't know what to do.

**Weak CTAs:**
- "Click here"
- "Learn more"
- Low contrast buttons
- Too many CTAs at once

**Strong CTAs:**
```
✅ "Start 14-day free trial"
✅ "Download free ebook"
✅ "Book free consultation"
✅ "See our work"
```

**CTA Colors:**
- High contrast with background
- Consistent throughout site
- One main CTA per section

## 8. No Social Proof

**Problem:** Lack of trust indicators.

**What's Missing:**
- Customer reviews
- Case studies
- Partner logos
- Certificates and awards
- Numbers (clients, projects, years of experience)

**Example:**
```markdown
💬 "Bitspire built our store in 6 weeks. 
    Sales increased by 150%!" 
    - John Smith, CEO Tech Store

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5.0/5.0 from 50+ reviews
```

## 9. Accessibility Issues

**Problem:** Site inaccessible to people with disabilities.

**WCAG 2.1 Basics:**
```html
<!-- Bad -->
<div onclick="submit()">Submit</div>

<!-- Good -->
<button type="submit" aria-label="Submit form">
  Submit
</button>
```

**Checklist:**
✅ Alt text for images
✅ Keyboard navigation
✅ Screen reader compatibility
✅ Skip to content link
✅ Focus indicators

## 10. No Clear Value Proposition

**Problem:** User doesn't know what you offer within 5 seconds.

**Bad Homepage:**
```
❌ "Welcome to our site"
❌ Generic slogans
❌ Focus on yourself instead of customer
```

**Good Homepage:**
```
✅ "Increase online sales by 150% 
    in 90 days - guaranteed"
✅ Specific benefits
✅ Clear CTA
✅ Social proof
```
